📚 Simple Java Library Program

This is a basic program for managing a library using Java. It runs in the console (the black-and-white text screen on your computer) and helps you keep track of books. It was a great project for practicing Java skills.

✨ What It Can Do

* **📖 Add Books:** Add new books with a title and author.
* **👀 See All Books:** Look at a full list of your books and see which ones are available.
* **🔎 Find a Book:** Quickly search for a book by its title.
* **↪️ Check Out & Return:** Mark books as borrowed or returned.
* **💾 Save Data:** Automatically saves your book list to a file, so you don't lose your work when you close the program.

### 🚀 How to Use It

You'll need the Java Development Kit (JDK) on your computer.

1.  **Compile:** Open your terminal and run:
    `javac Library.java`
2.  **Run:** Then, run this command:
    `java Library`

A menu will appear, and you can start managing your library!

### 🛠️ What It's Made Of

* **Java:** The programming language used to build everything.
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** The code is organized into logical parts, like a `Book` object and a `LibraryManager` object, to keep it neat.
* **Java Serialization:** This is how the program saves your library data to a file (`library_data.ser`) so it's there the next time you open it.
