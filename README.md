📚 e-LibraryManager ->
Welcome to my Library Management System! This is a straightforward, easy-to-use console application
built with Java. It's designed to manage a collection of books, making it simple to keep track of what's
in the library and who has what.
This project was a great way for me to practice core Java concepts, especially object-oriented
programming and handling files.

✨ Features ->
❖ Add New Books: Easily add new books to the library with a title and author.
❖ View All Books: Get a complete list of every book in the system and see its availability.
❖ Search for a Book: Quickly find a specific book by its title.
❖ Issue & Return: Check books out and return them, automatically updating their status.
❖ Data Persistence: The system saves all your data to a local file, so you'll never lose your
library's records when you close the program.

🚀 How to Run ->
Getting this running on your own machine is simple.
1. Prerequisites: Make sure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
2. Compile the Code: Open your terminal, navigate to the project folder, and run:
javac Library.java
3. Run the Program: Once it's compiled, run the application with:
java Library
The menu will pop up, and you're ready to start managing your library!

🛠 Technologies Used ->
-> Java: The core language for the entire application.
-> Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The project is built using classes and objects (Book,
LibraryManager) to keep the code clean and organized.
-> Java Serialization: Used to save the state of the library to a file (library_data.ser), making the
data persistent.
